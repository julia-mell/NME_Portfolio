                Bird Screensaver was created as my Programming for Visual Artists final project.
                I chose to approach this by drawing inspiration from what the function of most screensavers are and how it can be made continuous. 
                Bird Screensaver is a full screen semi-random screensaver with birds either going forwards or backwards across the screen. 
                The longer the screen saver goes on, the more birds and sounds are added to the imagery. 
                At some point the clear sky background will change due to the amount of birds shown from how long time has passed. 
                The more birds appearing on the screen - the more time has passed, unlike other screensavers that only loop until the user clicks something.
                It's created using arrays, functions, and a class that all allow for randomness.

                Scribble Baby was created as my Midterm for Programming for Visual Artists.
                I chose to approach this by getting inspiration from child-like older drawing programs, making it simple looking and easy to use. 
                Scribble Baby consists of 3 paint brush shapes, a save, a reset, standard colors, and random colors the user can click through. 
                It's created with unique functions and if statements that allows the program to be interactive.

                2 Cams was originally created and turned in for Programming for Visual Artists as a regular assignment on utilizing a webcam.
                I later came back to it and revised, which became a completely different project.
                I originally chose to approach this by only using filters and having them change based on mouse placement.
                I then re-worked it entirely to be the point of view of the user being on camera in a red-pink lit room, inspired by two different camera types.
                The first camera is a regular Canon DSLR, displaying a higher quality capture.
                The second camera is a 2000's Casio EX-Z750, displaying a more pixeled quality capture.
                2 Cams was created using unique functions and a nested For Loop.
